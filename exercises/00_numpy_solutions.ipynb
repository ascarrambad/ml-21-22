    "\n",
    "- The main data structure is the array, which can be multi-dimensional\n",
    "\n",
    "    - number/scalar: 0-dimensional array\n",
    "        - Example: `np.array(3)`\n",
    "    - vector: 1-d array\n",
    "        - Example: `np.array([3, 1, 5])`\n",
    "    - matrix: 2d array \n",
    "        - Example: `np.array([[1, 2], [3, 2]])`\n",
    "    - tensor: d-dimensional array (very recurrent concept in machine learning and ML libraries, such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), so you'd better get used to it!)\n",
    "        - Example: `np.array([[[1, 1], [3, 3]]])`\n",
    "- An array has \n",
    "\n",
    "    - data (e.g. numbers) \n",
    "    - shape (dimensions)\n",
    "    - type (all elements of the array have this type, so this is different from Python lists, and this is one of the reasons that makes NumPy more efficient)\n",
    " \n",
    "- You can perform many operations on arrays, such as\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - [Resizing, reshaping, changing the type, concatenating arrays, etc.](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.array-manipulation.html)\n",
    "        - Example: from `np.array([[1, 2], [3, 2]])` to `array([[1, 2, 3, 2]])`), \n",
    "    - [indexing/slicing](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.indexing.html) (select one or more elements from the array)\n",
    "        - This can be done in different ways in NumPy\n",
    "    - [statistical operations](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.statistics.html) (such as taking the mean, standard deviation, etc., of all or some elements)\n",
    "    - [linear algebra operations](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.linalg.html) (transpose, dot product, matrix multiplications, norm, eigenvectors, eigenvalues, solve linear systems, etc.)\n",
    "    - [other mathematical operations](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.math.html)  (e.g. trigonometric functions, such as sine, cosine, etc.)\n",
    "    - [logical](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.logic.html) and [binary](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.bitwise.html) operations\n",
    "    - [Sorting, searching, and counting](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.sort.html)\n",
    "    - [Fourier transforms](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.fft.html) (maybe a bit too advanced for you now)\n",
    "            \n",
    "- We can create arrays in different ways depending on our needs (by specifying the data and shape of the array and sometimes the type)\n",
    "    - From Python built-in iterables (e.g. lists or tuples)\n",
    "    - By randomly generating them by sampling the elements from uniform, Gaussian, etc., distributions\n",
    "    - With specific values (e.g. an array of all zeros, or an array of all ones)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operations on arrays can be element-wise (aka component-wise)\n",
    "    - Example: multiply a number for all elements of an array (but you can also multiply a number by a specific element of the array, rather than all of them)\n",
    "    - This is actually just an implementation of similar linear algebra concepts (such as scalar-vector multiplication)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Vectorized operations](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/edoc/imm3274.pdf)\n",
    "    - The idea that certain operations that you usually perform only with numbers can also be performed/implemented with arrays\n",
    "    - You often need to think in terms of vectors, matrices or multi-dimensional arrays in machine learning (you need this mindset)\n",
    "    - For instance, `(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2` , where `a` and `b` are real numbers, has the vectorized counterpart `(a + b)(a - b) = aa^T - bb^T`, where `a` and `b` are m-dimensional vectors and `T` is the transpose operation\n",
    "        - Example: `a = [1, 2]` and `b = [2, 2]`, then `(a + b)(a - b) = ([1, 2] + [2, 2])([1, 2] - [2, 2]) = [3, 4] • [-1, 0] = -3`, which is equal to `[1, 2]•[1, 2]^T - [2, 2]•[2, 2]^T = 5 - 8 = -3`, where `•` is the dot product symbol.\n",
    "        \n",
    "- [Broadcasting](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/theory.broadcasting.html?highlight=broadcasting) (i.e. how arrays are treated when arrays of different dimensions/shapes are involved in an operation)\n",
    "    - Example: `a * b`, where `a = 2.0` and `b = np.array([1, 2])`, becomes `np.array([2.0, 4.0])`.\n",
    "        - This is just the simple case of scalar-vector multiplication, which is a very common linear algebra operation, but there are more advanced \"broadcasting\" situations\n",
    "        \n",
    "- Many operations in NumPy do not create a new array out of the array that the operation is applied to, but only a reference (aka \"view\") to it, this means that modifying the reference can also modify the original object (side effects)\n",
    "    - Example: [slicing/indexing creates a view/reference to the specific sub-part of the array](https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/ViewsVsCopies.html)\n",
    "    - In any case, when you need, you can make (deep) copies of objects to avoid side effects!\n",
    "        - Example: once I was trying to solve a problem that required a NumPy array with floating-point numbers but I was wronly using an array of integers (I was not able to find the correct solution until I realised this mistake)\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy is [efficient](https://stackoverflow.com/q/8385602/3924118) because \n",
    "    - the Python functions actually often call some pre-compiled C code or other compiled code or libraries (e.g. [BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas/))\n",
    "    - the elements of the same array have the same type, so certain optimizations can be made (e.g. you don't need to check that the elements of that array have the same type in order to perform some operation)\n",

To quickly edit code, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is also quite neat. Of course, you can also use Google Colab or Jupyter notebooks, especially when a notebook is required, rather than a Python module (which ends with `.py` rather than `.ipynb`, like this notebook). "
